# gristcli

This is a CLI tool to manage [grist](https://github.com/gristlabs/grist-core), as currently it is only distributed as a Docker image.

Note: this is a hacky tool made quickly, kind of does the job.

Configurations:
* -dir: by default uses /grist under user's home directory as its mount path.
* -email: by default uses test@example.com as user email
